// Task
// Try to add 21 and 40 in code and print the result. Remember, we don't need "" (double quotes) when printing numbers.

// Comments
// Notice that on the editor on the right, the instructions appear in gray color.
// This is because they are comments and don't affect the code.
// The way we write comments is by adding "//" at the start of a line.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  // Replace the underscores
  printf("%d",21+40);
return 0;
}
